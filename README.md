A variety of SQL queries for basic data analysis of a [music database](WSDA_Music.db). WSDA music is a large database of track sales, containing data like album sales and reviews. These programs were written using DB Browser for SQLite.

# Averages

The [averages](Averages.sql) project uses basic HAVING functionality to identify cities with a high level of average spending.

# Grouping 

[Grouping](GroupingTest.sql) extends this same direction of program to order cities by average spending, specifically identifying cities which start with `B`.

# Joins 

The [joins](JoinTest.sql) file leverages the advantages of relational databases connecting customer and employee tables to identify the customer service representatives attached to individual customers. 

# Clear Queries 

The [sorting](GeneralSort.sql) project ties these concepts together, combining stratifying listeners in specific cities.
